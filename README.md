# 🥑 Avocado Sales Analysis – Case Study 1

This project is an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on **Avocado sales data**, where we explore how avocado sales vary by volume, type, region, and time. The analysis focuses on uncovering patterns using real-world data and visual storytelling.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To analyze avocado sales data and identify trends in:
- Sales volumes (small, large, x-large)
- Fruit types (conventional vs organic)
- Regional distribution
- Yearly and seasonal variations
- Pricing trends and outliers

---

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries

- **Python**
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation
- **NumPy** – Numerical operations
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** – Visualizations
- **Jupyter Notebook**

---

## 📊 Steps Performed

1. **Data Loading & Initial Exploration**
   - Identified important columns (`4046`, `4225`, `4770`)
   - Recognized dataset as avocado sales and pricing info

2. **Data Cleaning**
   - Renamed unnamed and numeric columns for readability
   - Verified no missing/null values

3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Extracted year-wise and fruit-type-specific insights

4. **Data Visualization**
   - Year-wise and fruit-type distribution
   - Regional comparison for 2015
   - Outlier analysis on average price
   - Correlation heatmap

5. **Outlier Handling**
   - Applied **IQR method** on average price

6. **Correlation Analysis**
   - Assessed relationships between volume, price, and types

---

## 📈 Key Insights

- Sales volumes differ greatly by **fruit type** and **region**
- **Conventional avocados** dominate the market share
- Outliers in pricing exist and are addressed using statistical methods
- Strong correlation found between volume types and total sales
- Seasonal trends and year-wise changes observed
